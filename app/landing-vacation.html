                            <p>The benefits of a robust vacation rentals system are there for you to see, but now you need to choose the right one to take all the benefits and improve your hospitality business. With a plethora of options online to pick from, it can be quite challenging to choose the right system for your business. Therefore, to make an informed choice, we've compiled a few important things to look out for in these systems before you make your choice.</p>

                        </div>
                        <h6>Booking Website Builder</h6>
                    </div>
                    <p>The booking website is the basis of all the marketing efforts, which so makes the website builder a must-have feature for an event rentals system to be considered excellent. Even if you are averagely good with technology, you still have to make sure this feature is incorporated in the system, and this is because this is where bookings can be processed independently of the online travel agencies.</p>
                    <p>The system pulls up the client's listings from the database, and straight into the direct booking site. More importantly, these systems don't have to be complicated; not all users have profound knowledge about technology; therefore, keeping it simple and functional is vital.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="landing__card wow fadeInUp">
                    <span class="landing__card-counter"></span>
                    <div class="landing__card-top">
                        <div class="landing__card-icon">

                        </div>
                        <h6>Booking Engine</h6>
                    </div>
                    <p>Reports have it that the US travelers had spent close to $189billion on online travel bookings this year alone. This is clear that having an integrated booking engine, which should accept online bookings and payments, on your vacation rentals system is as crucial as having a website at all. These days, people are more comfortable making payments online via their debit cards, perhaps the safest way to make payments. If your hospitality system doesn't have this option, you are likely to lose some potential clients to other renters who can.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="landing__card wow fadeInUp">
                    <span class="landing__card-counter"></span>

                        </div>
                        <h6>Channel Manager</h6>
                    </div>
                    <p>A channel manager is a must-have for property managers that handle multiple listings, but in most of the vacation rentals systems, this feature is not a standard one; therefore, there might be a need for some extra digging to find it. What the channel manager does for property managers is to help synchronize bookings from external listings into a single user-friendly hub.</p>

                    <p>More so, channel manager enables rentals managers to update some aspects of their listings, which can include pushing their listing from one booking agency to another one for better publicity and revenue, and a simultaneous update on listing pricing and descriptions. All these so make this feature a crucial one to ensure a vacation rentals system has before purchasing one.</p>

                        <h6>Unified Inbox</h6>
                    </div>
                    <p>A unified inbox is a feature in the vacation rentals system that makes the property manager's communication with their guest a lot easier by centralizing all the messages into a single digital platform, inbox. From this hub, you can reply to lots of guest's complaints, contributions, and inquiries without a drop of sweat.</p>

                    <p>A robust vacation rentals system should have a separate portal where the property owner can view all the vital information, which includes reservation schedules, about the properties being managed. This makes things easy for the manager to oversee several properties from a single portal.</p>
