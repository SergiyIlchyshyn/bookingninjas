								<p>This is where we engage in a series of discussions with you to know exactly what you want and how you want to get it. From this discussion, we will get valuable data like dreams and goals for the near future in your business. We will make a detailed analysis of your business structure so as to determine how much you stand to gain by adopting the Booking Ninjas system. By taking this necessary step, we ensure maximum results from the application for your organization.</p>
								<p>It is basically the question stage. In this phase, we ask business-related questions such as:</p>
								<ul>
									<li>Are you determined to find a lasting solution for your organizational needs?</li>
									<li>Are you willing and ready to put in the necessary time, effort, and resources to achieve the desired results?</li>
