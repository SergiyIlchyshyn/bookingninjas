                    <h2>What’s our system all about?</h2>
                    <p>Have you ever had to enter a building then get delayed because the man at the gate had to do something else? Or you’ve had to join a long queue of cars at the gate for payment to be made, on a day when you are so late for a meeting? That feeling of frustration that you felt? That’s what a parking management system can eradicate.</p>
                    <p>For companies, communities, and estates, which require several parking protocols, it is usually not an easy task to manage, especially when it involves hundreds of cars too. Dozens of vehicles try to make their way through within minutes, leaving a lot of work and responsibilities on the human parking manager available. Even worse, it leaves workers or people trying to access the building in frustration and exasperation. That is one reason why getting a parking management system is one of the best decisions a company can make. It covers that area.</p>
                    <p>What about buildings with only hardware that controls the payment and access into the building? Have you been there on a day when it’s faulty or very slow? It’s usually no different from the manual “man on guard” system too, and that is just another reason to pick a car parking management system.</p>

                                <h6>Security</h6>
                            </div>
                            <p>One of the significant advantages of a parking management system is that it provides security. There is a barrier and reservation feature that controls the vehicles which have access to a place. This way, it can lock out some at certain times, if programmed to do so. There’s also a surveillance camera (CCTV) which monitors vehicles and can even be used for reference, in the case that there’s a need.</p>

                            </div>
                            <p>The parking management system doesn’t rely on a man to do the job; instead, it deals with software and smartphones, which are less likely to make mistakes. The man at the gate deals with a lot of people at once; he can get tired and even can become ill or absent from work. On the other hand, automated software always works as long as you have your phone on, which is quite often. You get to decide how you want to pay or what you want to do precisely. As a result, the level of efficiency increases, and you get to deal with parking protocols without issues.</p>

                            </div>
                            <P>Our car park control system is ahead of its time. Having to stand at the gate and wait for the human guard to finish dealing with one person before going ahead can be daunting and time-wasting? So what if you could handle your parking protocols yourself and be the determinant of when you enter the building without delay? One of the advantages of a parking management system is that you can do this very quickly. Employees can avoid the long queue at the gate every morning and go right ahead to enter the building or make use of the parking space on their own.</P>

                            </div>
                            <p>When the man at the gate is busy, who do you ask questions on the parking protocols? Or in the case of the hardware system, do you talk to the machines? For the modern parking management system, which makes use of software, you can ask various questions through your phone. Questions on spaces, occupancy, overstay, or illegal parking? They can all be answered from wherever you are. Our car park management solutions give you the best experience you deserve.</p>

                            </div>
                            <p>The modern software-oriented type of parking management system also involves reporting. Not only does it make things easier for users, but managers also enjoy a fair share of having workload reduced for them when it comes to monitoring and managing parking spaces. They receive reports on the vehicles in the building, as well as the time of access. The need for paper and pencil way of recording is no longer necessary, and things are automated. There’s even the option of one-on-one counting of vehicles.</p>

                            <p>Installing the parking management system incurs a one-time cost. But when you have to deal with other systems, there is the need to pay or fund regularly. An organization that opts for this system is one that is sure to have its costs reduced, compared to others.</p>
